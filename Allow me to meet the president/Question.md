The general public needs approval from police commission to meet the president,initialy they have to meet the Health department and get the acceptance from them So character "P" will be added with their Token number Txxxx. Like wise they need to get approval from another 3 Goverment departments which has characters "A" , "M" and "S"

once they have completed all the process then the character "T" will be replaced by "C" and will be allowed to meet the president

Create a function which translates a given token number string into approved token number.

A successful example would be (as they have obtained approval from all the departments):

"T010PAMS" => "C010PAMS"

"T010AMS" => "T010AMS"
