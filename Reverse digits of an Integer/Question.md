Assume we are dealing with an environment that could only store integers within the 32-bit signed integer range: [-2^31, 2^31 - 1]. For the purpose of this problem, assume that your function returns 0 when the reversed integer overflows.

Input Format

The first line of the input 32 bit signed integer in the form x=val (refer to the sample test case for a guide)

Constraints

-2^31 <= x <= 2^31-1

Output Format

The reversed integer (refer to sample testcase)

Sample Input 0

x = 123
Sample Output 0

321
Explanation 0

Input x = 123 reverse 321
