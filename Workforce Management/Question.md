SLIIT wants their staff to finish their assigned tasks in a shorter duration. To finish the tasks faster, the staff have requested more hands, as they cannot reduce the schedule with the same number of team members. Currently, SLIIT knows how many days it takes for certain number of people to complete a given task. But they don't know how many people it will take to complete the same task given a tighter schedule. Please help them come up with the solution, so they may allocate the necessary human resources to perform the task.
