Royal Brains Collage has one large biomedical laboratory. Students passed from secondary are already enrolled to do experiments inside the lab for their practical examinations. Maximum possible number of students per session in the laboratory is 60 and at least 30 students should enroll per session. Before starting the practical sessions, the procurement management of the college has decided to buy new tools and equipment. For that, a stock-taking will be conducted. Inside the biomedical laboratory there are stools of 4 different heights. The heights can be labeled as 1,2,3 and 4 where tallest ones are 4. Find how many are tallest from the stools in the laboratory.
