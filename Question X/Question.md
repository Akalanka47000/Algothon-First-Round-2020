Each day a tank will be filled with water during the night time, and will be known as the inlet (in liters). Water will decrease during the day time due to the consumption and that is known as Usage (in liters). Initially the tank has zero liters before starting to fill with water.

You need to calculate when (in days) the target level of water will be reached in the water tank.

for example :
-Input 
    first line inlet (in liters), an integer value
    second line usage (in liters) , an integer value
    third line target (in liters), an integer value

 -Output
     an integer value (in days)
